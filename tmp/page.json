  "about": Some know me as Mr. Sulu but I hope all know me as a believer in, and a fighter for, the equality & dignity of all human beings. Email: teamtakei@ohmyyy.gt,
  "bio": Many of you know me best for my portrayal of Mr. Sulu in the groundbreaking television and film series Star Trek. I've also been in 40+ feature films and what must be hundreds of television guest-starring appearances.

More recently, I'm a regular guest on The Howard Stern Show on Sirius XM Radio.  I also starred in the NBC television series "Heroes" and in the movie "Larry Crowne" opposite Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. I played "Hologramps" in Nickelodeon's "Supah Ninjas," recently appeared as a guest on Celebrity Apprentice in 2012, and voiced the part of S.T.E.V.E. in the movie "Freebirds."

Next season, I will star in a new Broadway-bound musical entitled "Allegiance" (music and lyrics by Jay Kuo, book by Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione), which premiered at San Diego's Old Globe Theater to sold-out crowds. Allegiance won "Outstanding New Musical" from the Craig Noel Theater Critics Awards and broke the Old Globe's 70 year box office record. For more information, see www.allegiancemusical.com.
